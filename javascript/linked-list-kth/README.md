# Challenge Title
## Linked List Kth From End
> This coding challenge is to create Linked List methods - kth-from-end. This method returns the node's value that is "k" palces from the tail of the linked list.

### Whiteboard Process

### Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

1. LinkedList.kthFromEnd()
  * Time Complexity - O(n) - worst case is traversing the whole linked list 
  * Space Complexity - O(1) - constant even with two pointers as they only occupy a fixed amount of memory.

### Solution
