## Hash Map Left Join
> This coding challenge is to write a function that LEFT JOINs two hashmaps into a single data structure.

### Whiteboard Process

### Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

1. leftJoin(hashmap1, hashmap2)
  * Time Complexity - O(n)
  * Space Complexity - O(1)
