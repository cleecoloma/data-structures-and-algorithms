# Challenge Title
## Trees Breadth First
> This coding challenge is to implement trees method breadth first where it takes in tree and returns a list of values encountered in the tree.

### Whiteboard Process
![Trees](../images/trees.png)
![Trees - findMax](../images/trees-findmax.png)

### Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

1. breadthFirst(tree)
  * Time Complexity - O(n)
  * Space Complexity - O(n)

### Solution
<!-- Show how to run your code, and examples of it in action -->
