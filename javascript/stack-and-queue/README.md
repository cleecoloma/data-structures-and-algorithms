# Challenge Title
## Stack And Queue
> This coding challenge is to utilize a Linked List as the underlying data storage mechanism to implement both a `Stack` and a `Queue.`

### Whiteboard Process

### Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

1. LinkedList.zip()
  * Time Complexity - O(max(n,m)) - where n is the length of the first linked list while m is the length of the second linked list.
  * Space Complexity - O(1) - constant because output doesn't grow with the linked list lengths
