# Challenge Title
## Hash Table
> This coding challenge is to implement hash table.

### Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

1. set(key, value)
  * Time Complexity - O(n)
  * Space Complexity - O(1)
2. get(key)
  * Time Complexity - O(n)
  * Space Complexity - O(1)
3. has(key)
  * Time Complexity - O(n)
  * Space Complexity - O(1)
4. keys
  * Time Complexity - O(n)
  * Space Complexity - O(n)
