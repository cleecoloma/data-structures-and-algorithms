# Challenge Title
## Insertion Sort
> This coding challenge is to implement insertion sort that builds the final sorted array one element at a time. It iterates through the input array and repeatedly inserts each unsorted element into its correct position within the sorted portion of the array.

### Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

1. insertionSort(array)
  * Time Complexity - O(n^2)
  * Space Complexity - O(1)
